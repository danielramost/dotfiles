# Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles. I only use a handful of tools whose config files are worth backing up and they don't change often. So, I dropped the bare repository approach and started commiting changes to my files by copying them manually from the source files to the repo.

It's not an optimal workflow, but as I don't tinker a lot with my config files, it works.
